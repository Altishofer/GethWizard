The instructions below will guide you on how to set up and run the project locally.

## Features

- Simple generation of docker-compose.yml
- Deploys by default
  - one bootnode
  - one oracle (rest api)
  - three validator nodes (PoA)
  - one non-validator node (rpc api)
- Newly generated addresses and primary keys with each deployment
- provides many templates for oracle server and external client

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Docker-Desktop V4.26.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4260) 
- [Python V3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/)


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Install dependencies
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
3. Start Docker-Desktop

4. Clone the repository

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Altishofer/GethWizard.git
   ```

5. Change into the cloned repository directory:

   ```shell
   cd GethWizard
   ```

6. Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip3 install requirements.txt
   ```

7. Start the blockchain:

   ```shell
   python3 main
   ```

8. Simulate an external service interacting with the chaincode ðŸŽ‰
   ```shell
   python3 external_call_template.py
   ```

## Interaction & Debugging
- see app.py in /oracle and external_service.py to see detailed structure of requests
- Metamask
  - Add new blockchain blockchain on Metamask by url: http://localhost:8545
  - call http://localhost:8081/faucet with body {"address":<hexAddress>} to load any wallet-address with tokens
- Remix
  - Connect Metamask
  - Set advanced compiler configurations >> EMV version >> Paris
  - Compile chaincode.sol with compiler: 0.8.22
  - call http://localhost:8081/getContract to get the address of the deployed contract
  - provide remix with the contract's address to interact
- Postman
  - remote-procedure-calls (rpc) via http://localhost:8545
  - representational state transfer (rest) via http://localhost:8081
